# HIGHT
### Introduction

HIGHT is a lightweight block cipher that accepts a 64-bit plaintext and 128-bit master key. Through this Python3 implementation, we attempt to shed light on the complexities of this cipher (in ECB mode). Original paper with pseudocode and detailed explanation of the cipher can be found <a href = "https://iacr.org/archive/ches2006/04/04.pdf">here</a>.

### How to use

To encrypt and decrypt, use functions ```hight_encryption(P, MK)``` and ```hight_decryption(C, MK)``` respectively. Do import all functions found in <i>hight.py</i> to ensure that cipher is working well.

You would need to edit the values for the master key (MK) and plaintext (P) in the code. Here are some example values for MK, P and ciphertext (C):

```python
MK = [0x88, 0xE3, 0x4F, 0x8F, 0x08, 0x17, 0x79, 0xF1, 0xE9, 0xF3, 0x94, 0x37, 0x0A, 0xD4, 0x05, 0x89]
P = [0xD7, 0x6D, 0x0D, 0x18, 0x32, 0x7E, 0xC5, 0x62]

abstract="In this paper, we propose a new block cipher HIGHT with 64-bit block length and 128-bit key length. It provides low-resource hardware implementation, which is proper to ubiquitous computing device such as a sensor in USN or a RFID tag. HIGHT does not only consist of simple operations to be ultra-light but also has enough security as a good encryption algorithm. Our hardware implementation of HIGHT requires 3048 gates on 0.25 $\mu$m technology.",
